// Chama — Holder-only shares (escrow safety)

// See docs/DESIGN-holder-only-shares.md. Pure helpers for the "holder-only-v1"
// share policy: each 2-of-3 SSS share is encrypted to ONLY its assigned holder,
// so no one party can reconstruct alone. Reconstruction needs a second share,
// re-encrypted to the payout recipient by an *agreeing voter* (the cryptographic
// 2-of-3). These functions are pure — no relays, no money, no crypto — so the
// share→holder mapping and the reconstruction-selection logic are unit-testable
// in isolation; the Fedimint bridge wires them to real encrypt/decrypt.
